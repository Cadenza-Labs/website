## Kaarel Hänni (Lead Research Scientist)
Kaarel was in the MATS Winter 2023 Cohort under the mentorship of John Wentworth. He is working on the interpretability agenda outlined in [“Searching for a model's concepts by their shape – a theoretical framework"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Go5ELsHAyw7QrArQ6) as a theorist at Cadenza Labs, a research team formed during MATS with Georgios Kaklamanos, Kay Kozaronek, and Walter Laurito. Kaarel has undergraduate degrees in mathematics and in linguistics & philosophy from MIT and is currently on leave from graduate school in mathematics at Caltech.

## Walter Laurito (CEO & Research Engineer)

Walter was in the MATS Winter 2023 Cohort under the mentorship of John Wentworth. At Cadenza, he splits his time between being CEO-ing and research engineering. With other collaborators, his team created an [open-source library](https://github.com/EleutherAI/elk), where Walter is a main contributor. Walter is also a PhD student in machine learning (mostly on pause / minimal effort right now). Before starting his PhD, Walter was working as software engineer for a couple of years after graduating in CS. 

## Georgios Kaklamanos (Operations)
Georgios was in the MATS Winter 2023 Cohort under the mentorship of John Wentworth. At Cadenza, he primarily works on operations. Outside alignment, his current focus is improvisation, specifically in improv theater and rhythm tap, intending to figure out how these concepts can be transferred to everyday life.

## Jonathan Ng (Research Engineer)
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-ng-7061a3162/)

Jonathan started actively working in the AI Alignment field in June 2022 by completing MLSS and ARENA. This was followed up with participation in the 2023 Spring SERI MATS program under Dan Hendrycks, where he co-authored the paper introducing the MACHIAVELLI benchmark (ICML 2023).

At Cadenza, Jonathan is working as a research engineer, focusing on expanding the [Discovering Latent Knowledge paper by Burns et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03827) in novel directions. The work can be found at this GitHub repo.
In his spare time, Jonathan likes building mechanical keyboards, doing weekend projects, playing video games, reading science fiction, and playing Person Do Thing.

## Jake Mendel (Research Scientist)
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-m-b05289126/)

Jake got into Alignment in April 2023, on a grant from Open Philanthropy. In his work as a research scientist with Cadenza Labs, he is working on the 'Specific Directions Within the Search for Features' agenda (github repo), and is beginning to think about how model factorization can shed light on the structure of cognition inside LMs. Jake has an undergraduate degree in physics and a master's in theoretical physics from Cambridge. He started a graduate medical degree at Oxford before dropping out to focus on AI Safety.
