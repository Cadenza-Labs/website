## Walter Laurito (Team Lead & Research Engineer)
https://www.linkedin.com/in/walter-laurito-951565144/

Walter is a SERI MATS alumni under the mentorship of John Wentworth and an ML PhD student (mostly on pause / minimal effort right now). He is working on interpretability in a team with Georgios Kaklamanos, Kaarel Hänni and Kay Kozaronek, where he takes on the role as a team lead and research engineer. With other collaborators, his team created an open-source library ( https://github.com/EleutherAI/elk ), where Walter is a main contributor. Before SERI MATS and starting his PhD, Walter was working as software engineer for a couple of years after graduating in CS. More information about the current agenda of Walter’s team can be found on Lesswrong ( https://www.lesswrong.com/users/walt-1 ).

## Georgios Kaklamanos (Operations)
Georgios was in the MATS Winter 2023 Cohort under the mentorship of John Wentworth. He is working on interpretability in a team with Kaarel Hänni, Kay Kozaronek, and Walter Laurito, where he primarily works on Science Communication. The team's work resulted in an open-source repository in collaboration with ElutherAI and 2 posts on LessWrong outlining ideas for future work and a theoretical framework. Outside alignment, his current focus is Improvisation, specifically in Improv Theater and Rhythm Tap, intending to figure out how these concepts can be transferred and improv everyday life.

## Kaarel Hänni (Lead Research Scientist)
Kaarel was in the MATS Winter 2023 Cohort under the mentorship of John Wentworth. He is working on the interpretability agenda outlined in “Searching for a model's concepts by their shape – a theoretical framework" as a theorist in Notodai Research, a research team formed during MATS with Georgios Kaklamanos, Kay Kozaronek, and Walter Laurito. Kaarel has undergraduate degrees in mathematics and, in linguistics & philosophy from MIT and is currently on leave from graduate school in mathematics at Caltech.

## Jonathan Ng (Research Engineer)
https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-ng-7061a3162/ 

Jonathan started actively working in the AI Alignment field in June 2022 by completing. MLSS and ARENA. This was followed up with participation in the 2023 Spring SERI MATS program under Dan Hendrycks, where he co-authored the paper introducing the MACHIAVELLI benchmark (ICML 2023).

He is currently working as a research engineer on the team, focusing on expanding the Discovering Latent Knowledge paper by Burns et al. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03827) to novel research directions. The work can be found at this GitHub repo.
In his spare time, Jonathan likes building mechanical keyboards, doing weekend projects, playing video games, reading science fiction, and playing Person Do Thing.

## Jake Mendel (Research Scientist)
https://www.linkedin.com/in/jake-m-b05289126/

Jake got into Alignment in April 2023, on an OpenPhil grant, and is currently a research assistant at David Krueger's lab where he is trying to understand the inductive biases of SGD, and attempting to build more robust benchmarks for capability unlearning. In his work as a research scientist with Notodai, he is working on the 'Specific Directions Within the Search for Features' agenda (github repo), and is beginning to think about how model factorisation can shed light on the structure of cognition inside LMs. Jake has an undergraduate degree in Physics and a masters in Theoretical Physics from Cambridge. He started a graduate medical degree at Oxford before dropping out to focus on AI Safety
