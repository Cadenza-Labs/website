# Core Team

## Kaarel Hänni (Lead Research Scientist)
Kaarel was in the MATS Winter 2023 Cohort under the mentorship of John Wentworth. He is working on the interpretability agenda outlined in [“Searching for a model's concepts by their shape – a theoretical framework"](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Go5ELsHAyw7QrArQ6) as a theorist at Cadenza Labs. Kaarel has undergraduate degrees in mathematics and in linguistics & philosophy from MIT and is currently on leave from graduate school in mathematics at Caltech.

## Walter Laurito (Team Lead & Research Engineer)

Walter was in the MATS Winter 2023 Cohort under the mentorship of John Wentworth. At Cadenza Labs, he splits his time between being a team lead and research engineering. With other collaborators, his team created an [open-source library](https://github.com/EleutherAI/elk), where Walter is a main contributor. Before starting his PhD in ML (mostly on pause / minimal effort right now), Walter was working as software engineer for a couple of years after graduating in CS. 

## Jonathan Ng (Research Engineer)

Jonathan started actively working in the AI Alignment field in June 2022 by completing MLSS and ARENA. This was followed up with participation in the 2023 Spring SERI MATS program under Dan Hendrycks, where he co-authored the paper introducing the MACHIAVELLI benchmark (ICML 2023).

At Cadenza Labs, Jonathan is working as a research engineer, focusing on expanding the [Discovering Latent Knowledge paper by Burns et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03827) in novel directions. The work can be found at this GitHub repo.
In his spare time, Jonathan likes building mechanical keyboards, doing weekend projects, playing video games, reading science fiction, and playing Person Do Thing.
